# Cinema Booking System
This online Cinema ticket booking system is a web-based system where one can 
book movie tickets in advance, know their movie showing time, watch movie trailers, and 
read reviews. Any cinema has one or more rooms and each room contains a set of seats. Here, 
people will be able to see if the desired seat is reserved or not and booking can be done in
accordingly with ease. The respective price of the ticket will also be shown while booking the 
seat. This system aims at providing information about now-showing movies, releasing 
movies, their showing shifts, showing rates and others to the local people; online, that means 
people donâ€™t need to visit cinema, stay in a queue and return home with a disappointment if 
the hall is full and there are no seats. In addition to that, people should use this system to get 
information regarding the movies, their showing shifts and advance booking of the tickets.
